We may want to consider sending special values between the two before sending any actual meaningful data. 
This would allow us to control server state better. as it stands i'm basically just hacking stuff on as i
see fit. and i mean it'll work but i feel terrible for doing it
lol

my preliminary 5am ideas

1: login data incoming
2: chatroom name is next piece of data
3: send me a new list of chatroom names


without something like this i'm having a hell of a time making sure all of the streams are waiting for the right
things and having the right things written to them when neeeded, just check out the code lol
